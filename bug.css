The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you make a mistake in the calculation, the result may be unexpected and the CSS rule may not apply correctly. For example, if you try to subtract a larger value from a smaller value, the result will be negative, which is not a valid value for many CSS properties.  Another example involves forgetting spaces between operators and operands in a `calc()` expression which leads to unexpected behavior. Consider the following: `width: calc(100px -50px);` This will not produce the expected 50px width due to missing spaces.

Another uncommon issue is related to specificity in CSS. Unexpected behavior can occur when selectors have equal specificity and the order of declarations matters unexpectedly.   For instance, two classes with identical specificity but applied in the wrong order might cause the wrong style to be applied.
