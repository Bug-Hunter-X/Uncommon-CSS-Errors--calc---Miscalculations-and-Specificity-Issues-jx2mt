# Uncommon CSS Bugs

This repository demonstrates two uncommon but potentially frustrating bugs in CSS: incorrect usage of the `calc()` function and unexpected specificity issues. 

## Bug 1: `calc()` Miscalculations
The `calc()` function is powerful, but errors in its usage are easy to overlook.  The example shows how missing spaces or incorrect mathematical operations lead to unexpected results.

## Bug 2: Specificity Issues
CSS specificity can be tricky.  The example highlights a case where selectors with equal specificity interact unexpectedly based on their order of appearance in the stylesheet.

## Solutions
The `bugSolution.css` file provides corrected versions of the CSS demonstrating proper `calc()` usage and improved specificity management.  Read the comments in the code for further explanation.
